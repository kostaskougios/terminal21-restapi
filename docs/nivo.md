# Nivo

[Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/), "nivo provides a rich set of dataviz components, built on top of D3 and React".

terminal21 supports a few of these, but please add a comment [here](https://github.com/kostaskougios/terminal21-restapi/discussions/3) if you 
would like support for a particular component.
